# React Native Project :
This project was created by <u>Hadrien CONAN</u> and <u>Paul COMPAGNON</u> from ESIEE Paris. We are both beginners in React Native.
# The project : 
This application allows the user to create their own meal plan based on a precisely calculated Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). They can choose ingredients for each meal and see the corresponding calorie content. With this application, you can easily control and track your dietary intake throughout the week.
     
# How to set it up : 
- Clone the repo 
- We expect you to have Expo installed : 
https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/ 
- Then execute these commands :
```bash
cd .\Project\
yarn install
yarn start
```
If you are on an IOS, scan the QR code with your camera roll. \
If you are on an Android, scant the QR code with ExpoGo App.


# How to use it :
First, calcul your BMR throught "<b>Calcul your BMR</b>" tab, once you got it, navigate to "<b>Meal Planning</b>" tab to add your ingrediants for each meal and see if your objective for the day is complete. \
If you need some information or to add a specific ingrediant to one meal, you can go to the "<b>Find an ingredient</b>" tab
